## About the Project

Flowmodoro is a lightweight timer for macOS that supports the **Flowtime** (also known as Flowmodoro) technique.  
Instead of enforcing a strict work/break cycle (like 25/5 minutes), Flowmodoro lets you work **until you feel the need for a break**, and then automatically calculates the break length as a fraction of your work session.  

---

## Motivation

The traditional Pomodoro technique (e.g. 25 minutes of work + 5 minutes break) has its strengths but can be disruptive for developers, creatives, and knowledge workers because:

- It can break the **flow state** ‚Äî an alarm may interrupt deep focus.  
- Tasks don‚Äôt always fit neatly into fixed intervals.  
- Frequent forced breaks can increase **context switching costs**.  

The Flowtime / Flowmodoro method proposes a more flexible approach:

1. Start working on a single task.  
2. Continue until you feel the need for a break.  
3. Stop the timer ‚Äî that‚Äôs your actual work time.  
4. Break time = `(work duration) / 5`.  
5. Repeat the cycle.  

This method respects your natural rhythm and allows for more intentional work.

## Installation

1. Go to the **Releases** tab and download the latest version of the app.  
2. Open the downloaded application (right-click ‚Üí *Open* if macOS blocks unsigned apps).  
3. Move the app to your `/Applications` folder for easier access.

---

## Usage

- Launch the app ‚Äî the timer will appear.  
- Click **Start** when you‚Äôre ready to work.  
- When you need a break, click **Break**.  
- The app will calculate your break time.  
- After your break, it starts a new session.
